# Scientific research

UpRead has been entirely based on robust scientific literature.

The approach we use, RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation), has been studied since the '50s. It is still researched as its applications with smartphones and wereables are very promising.

In the area of speed reading, research is limited but shows promising results: users after a short practice period can get substantial benefits both in focus and in reading speed. Comprehension seems not to be affected.

We are already aware of some limitations on the approach and we're already exploring ways to overcome them. For example, handling of diagrams and images is not straightforward and content containing lots of data or references may not be a good fit for this technique.

Here's a list of the main scientific papers we used for UpRead. A psychologist has been in charge of researching the literature and supported the development of the app.
